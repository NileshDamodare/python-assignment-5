# Task 2: List Slicing

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Step 2: Extract first five elements
extracted = original_list[:5]

# Step 3: Reverse the extracted list
reversed_extracted = extracted[::-1]

# Step 4: Print everything
print("Original list:", original_list)
print("Extracted first five elements:", extracted)
print("Reversed extracted elements:", reversed_extracted)
